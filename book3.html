            <br />
            Daevabad has fallen.
            <br />
            <br />
            After a brutal conquest stripped the city of its magic, Nahid leader
            Banu Manizheh and her resurrected commander, Dara, must try to
            repair their fraying alliance and stabilize a fractious, warring
            people.
            <br />
            <br />
            But the bloodletting and loss of his beloved Nahri have unleashed
            the worst demons of Dara's dark past. To vanquish them, he must face
            some ugly truths about his history and put himself at the mercy of
            those he once considered enemies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having narrowly escaped their murderous families and Daevabad's
            deadly politics, Nahri and Ali, now safe in Cairo, face difficult
            choices of their own. While Nahri finds peace in the old rhythms and
            familiar comforts of her human home, she is haunted by the knowledge
            that the loved ones she left behind and the people who considered
            her a savior are at the mercy of a new tyrant. Ali, too, cannot help
            but look back, and is determined to return to rescue his city and
            the family that remains. Seeking support in his mother's homeland,
            he discovers that his connection to the marid goes far deeper than
            expected and threatens not only his relationship with Nahri, but his
            very faith.
            <br />
            <br />
            As peace grows more elusive and old players return, Nahri, Ali, and
            Dara come to understand that in order to remake the world, they may
            need to fight those they once loved . . . and take a stand for those
            they once hurt.
